# factorio_blueprints

A collection of Factorio blueprints that I want to keep.

## Fast Blueprint
This is a blueprint I am currently working on. It is an attempt to build a mega-base as fast as possible. To do this I want to build in stages as research advances, each stage building the components for the next stage.

### Stages
1. Get the resources to automate red research
1. Automate red research, belts, finish research for automation
1. Automate belts, inserters, walls, red/green research
1. Automate grey/blue research and other resources
1. Automate purple/yellow research, robots, trains, and other resources
1. Expand, setup ore trains and depot
1. Build rocket
1. Expand research

This blueprint covers stages 2-5.
